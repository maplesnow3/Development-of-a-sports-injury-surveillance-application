Django installation guide

if you running Windows:
1. Make sure you have python and pip installed. if not, go https://www.python.org/downloads/
install python, remember to add it to PATH, then open your Command Prompt, enter py get-pip.py

2.After you have pip installed, reopen your Command Prompt(if you cannot find it, just type cmd in the search bar of your pc (windows 10 and above))
type "pip install sklearn --user" to overcome the system issue comes with Windows

3.After you have sklearn installed, type "pip install Django==3.2" and enter

4.To verify your installation, go cmd, enter python, if you can see >>> from your cmd, means you are now using python, this is also a good test to see if you are really installed python

5.Now type in "import django" then enter, and type in "print(django.get_version())"

if you running MacOS:

idk, i'm too lazy to try installation on MacOS, so I only provide general processes

1.Install python on your Mac, Mac comes with Python 2.* version, which is not what we want, go get Python 3.10
2.Once you have python installed, use your "terminal" and input py get-pip.py
3.After you have pip installed, type "pip install Django==3.2" in the "terminal"
